### My Journey 🛤️

My journey began with the [**"FastTrackIT - Software Test Analyst Certified Course"**](https://fasttrackit.org/), where I gained hands-on experience in both **Manual** and **Automated Software Testing**.

During my "FastTrackIT" course, I successfully ✅ manually tested, created, and executed test scenarios for an [**e-Commerce**](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/) site from scratch using Selenium WebDriver in Java, further solidifying my theorethical and practical testing abilities.

I actually started in Octomber 2024 a [**"SQL Complete Mastery Course from Code With Mosh"**](https://codewithmosh.com/p/complete-sql-mastery) which I hope it will help me to learn databases to improve my knowledge.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss opportunities or share insights!
