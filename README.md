### My Journey 🛤️

My journey began with the [**"FastTrackIT - Software Test Analyst Certified® Course"**](https://fasttrackit.org/), where I gained hands-on experience in both **Manual** and **Automated Software Testing**.

During my "FastTrackIT" course, I successfully ✅ manually tested, created, and executed test scenarios for an [**e-Commerce**](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/) site from scratch using Selenium WebDriver in **Java**, further solidifying my theoretical and practical testing abilities.

I started a [**"SQL Complete Mastery Course from Code With Mosh"**](https://codewithmosh.com/p/complete-sql-mastery) in December 2024, which I hope will help me learn about databases and improve my knowledge.”

Feel free to connect with me to discuss opportunities or share insights!
