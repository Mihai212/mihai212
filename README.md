# Hello! üëã

I am a **growth Entry-level QA Software Tester** with a strong desire to enhance my knowledge and skills in order to deliver high-quality services to my future employer.

## My Journey üõ§Ô∏è

My journey began with the **"FastTrackIT - Software Test Analyst Certified Cours"**, where I gained hands-on experience in both **Manual** and **Automated Software Testing**.

During my "FastTrackIT" course, I successfully ‚úÖ manually tested, created, and executed test scenarios for an e-Commerce site [Link](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/) using Selenium WebDriver in Java, further solidifying my theorethical and practical testing abilities.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss opportunities or share insights!
