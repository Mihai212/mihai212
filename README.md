4. **Maven**
5. **Postman API**

During my "FastTrackIT" course, I successfully ✅ manually tested, created, and executed test scenarios for an e-Commerce site [Link](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/) using Selenium WebDriver in Java, further solidifying my theorethical and practical testing abilities.
